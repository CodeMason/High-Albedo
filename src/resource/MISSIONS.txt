[Mission]
name=Destroy Station
type=DESTROY_STATION
cash=250000>10000000
delta=0>2
briefing=We intend to hit an enemy space station, but due to politics can't be connected to the operation. We are looking for an experienced freelancer to destroy <TARGET> in <LOCATION>, so that plausible deniability can be constructed. As long as it dies, we don't want to know or care to know how you did it. You should know that a space station takes a fair bit of firepower to knock out, so grab some heavy hitters. Are you interested?
