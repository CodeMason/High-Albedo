----------
Removed from Que
* Sometimes undock stage 3 never ends [MAYBE FIXED]
* UTs seem to decide to fly into infinity. [COULD NOT REPRODUCE]
* Aborting a dock then manually docking with a different station docks you in the station you aborted. [COULD NOT REPRODUCE]

Still in Que
* Sometimes the autopilot avoid code does not avoid stations while in UT [CONFIRMED]
* NPCs stop firing when the target gets too close to them [CONFIRMED]

New
* Looped weapon effects don't always stop when their ship is destroyed [CONFIRMED]

Also, need to take a look at
-> Trade code, both ST and UT, needs a serious overhaul.
    - traders often fill up on goods they can't sell
        - problem is that they abort the sell operation because they'd sell at a loss
            - possibly make them keep looking for a place to sell this good?
            - possibly sell what you can and trash the rest?
        - another problem: they don't make sure their trade is still profitable right before buying
            - so they buy, fly all the way to the bad sell price station, and then can't sell.
    - traders leave profitable areas when there is momentarily no trade route
            - definately want them to migrate if there are no possible routes ever
            - but they need to stay if there was a trade route that is temporarily depleted

It might also help if players could see the price of goods at a station without docking.

Also, need to take a look at
-> NPCs getting stuck on stuff (until their fuel runs out / they kill themselves)
-> NPCs nudging stations off the map
-> UTs filling with useless wares due to failed trade runs
        -> either sell the stuff somewhere else or dump it and cut losses

Would be nice
-> UTs jump away when in danger
-> Report lost property to the player via message
-> Visible way of detecting incoming new messages (currently audio only)
