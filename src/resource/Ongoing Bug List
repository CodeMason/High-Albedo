----------
* Aborting a dock then manually docking with a different station docks you in the station you aborted. [UNCONFIRMED]
* UTs seem to decide to fly into infinity. [UNCONFIRMED]
* Sometimes undock stage 3 never ends [CONFIRMED]
* Sometimes the autopilot avoid code does not avoid stations while in UT [CONFIRMED]
* NPCs stop firing when the target gets too close to them [CONFIRMED]

Also, need to take a look at
-> NPCs getting stuck on stuff (until their fuel runs out / they kill themselves)
-> NPCs nudging stations off the map
-> UTs filling with useless wares due to failed trade runs
        -> either sell the stuff somewhere else or dump it and cut losses

Would be nice
-> UTs jump away when in danger
-> Report lost property to the player via message
-> Visible way of detecting incoming new messages (currently audio only)
