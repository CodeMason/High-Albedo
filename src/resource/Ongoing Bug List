Not bugs, but ideas on advancing the story.

In mission 3 you will join in a raid against an archers' convoy to discover that Cainan ships come to protect the archer convoy.
After destroying the convoy, and the Cainan ships, you will be informed that this is an unexpected development. You will then wait.

In mission 4 you will be informed that Orin intel indicates that Cainans have been responsible for paying off the Archers, not the ITC.
You are sent back to Grace to discover the Archers and Cainans are camping the gate, and are ambushing you! You are told to hold the
position while Ageiran escorts arrive, which takes about 1 minute, and then to destroy the camp.

After this, you are informed that Leeroy is ok with invading Grace with this new evidence. A joint Orin-Ageiran task force will be moving
out from Native Land into Grace to destroy some ITC installations and you are offered the chance to go along for the ride. The task force
will be ambushed a few times by the ITC, but will enter Grace and destroy the installations. 

At the end of this mission, you receive a message that the Ageirans will be setting up shop and you will be contacted again when you are
needed. 2 hours pass.

In mission 5 you will be informed that the ITC are launching a counter attack and that the forward installation in Grace is under threat.
The mission will be to report to Grace to defend the installation (NOTE: The attack will begin whether or not you enter Grace!) If the
installation is destroyed, the campaign ends. You are also informed by a secret admirer that you are fighting for the wrong side and
that the entire situation is the Orin's fault, but how this is true will not be mentioned.

With the help of the Ageiran forces, you will repel several waves of attackers and be rewarded with a gratuity gift of 2.5 million credits.
You will be told to wait for further instructions and to upgrade your ship with your newfound wealth.

In mission 6, you will receive another secret message saying that the Orin want the wormholes and are using the Ageirans as pawns. Then,
you will be told to report to the forward installation. Upon arriving you see an Ageiran escort group engaging a set of small entity ships.
After defeating them, the Agerians will proclaim this is proof of the ITC development of the entities and the Orin will agree. However...

Your admirer will inform you that the Orin have been experimenting in Grace and are indirectly responsible for the incident. You will be
informed that you will be summoned later and 45 minutes pass.

In mission 7, you are told that an Orin convoy needs to be escorted from Cosmic Way into Grace. This convoy includes an (unarmed) apparition. Your
admirer informs you that this Apparition is the real target, and that it must be destroyed. You are told in advance that there will be an
ambush in Cadence. You are told now is the time to choose whether or not you want to learn what is really going on or keep blindly following
the Orin's lead. If you help destroy the superfreighter, you will be offered the truth. If you succeed in getting it to Grace, you will never
know what is really going on and will set the human race back hundreds of years.

Sure enough, you are attacked in Cadence by a team of ITC, Cainan, and Archers' forces. The Archers and Cainans attack first, and when nearing the
Grace gate an ITC force attacks. If the freighter is destroyed, proceed to mission 8b. If you succeded in defending it, proceed to 8a.

In mission 8a, you are told that there is critical research to evacuate from Grace into Brash Pegasus. You will have to protect a captured ITC transport
as it travels to the Federal Supply Base in Brash Pegasus. You are informed that this is your last chance to prove yourself, and to destroy
that transport. If the transport reaches the destination, the campaign ends with Ending 1. If it is destroyed, the campaign ends with Ending 2.

In mission 8b, you are told by the Ageirans that if you are ever needed again they will find you. You are told by the admirer that if you want
to learn what is really going on you need to dock up in an ITC Research Station in Ecliptic Plane. Upon docking, you learn THE TRUTH and are
told that the research is onboard a stolen ITC transport. They want you to intercept and destroy the transport on your own. The transport will
spawn in Grace when you jump in, and you must stop it from reaching the forward installation. Once it is destroyed, go to Ending 3. Else, Ending 4.

Ending 1: The admirer informs you that the Orin are going to take some time to RE the device, but they might succeed. Since they are unpredictable, this would be trouble for the entire universe. There is a sudden spike in Entity spawns across the universe, the fighter type from before not the Nightmare. You are informed that this is directly related to the captured experiment but you are not told how since you can't be trusted. The Orin and Ageirans are elated at the success of the mission and are very thankful for your help, so thankful that they give you 5 million credits and promise that Skybus won't bother you again (they fix your skybus standings!).

Ending 2: You are not told how, but you are thanked for your help. Your ITC standings return to neutral but your Archer and Cainan standings are unaffected. The Ageirans are dissapointed at losing the research and politely inform you that you won't be needed again.

Ending 3: Your Ageiran and Orin standings are tanked but the ITC and Cainans love you. So do the Archers. You are rewarded with a 10 million credit hero prize and given a Zebra so
that you can start building your well deserved empire. The people you've met are, however, betrayed.

Ending 4: The worst possible ending. Not only has the transport reached the installation, but the Ageirans have learned of your betrayal and have tanked your standings to them and the Orin. You get no standings improvement from either the ITC or Cainans, due to your failure, but the Archers take pity and give you good standings with them because they like the way you think. You are pretty screwed and are essentially exiled to neutral space until you can fix your standings yourself.

THE TRUTH: The ITC had been developing the technology to generate wormholes in order to find new resources to use and expand their space into
unexplored regions. The Orin knew the ITC were developing something, but they did not know what it was. They did want it though. So the Orin
instigated the alliance between the Cainans and Archers in Grace to give the Ageirans a good reason to attack the ITC. Upon capturing Grace,
they were able to capture information that led them to discover what the research was. They had to get the prototype experiment safely back
to Orin space for study. The entities do not like wormhole experiments and will jump into the system if they detect one being attempted. The ITC
say they did not make the entities, but may have accidentally amplified their presence with these failed experiments.

Happy 300th Commit!

Here's to 300 more!

Removed From Que
* Sometimes the autopilot avoid code does not avoid stations while in UT [FIXED]
* Looped weapon effects don't always stop when their ship is destroyed [FIXED]
    - was observed again, fixed it by making the stop method more aggressive.
* Ships sometimes get stuck on DOCK_STAGE_3 when using the capital docking port. [FIXED]

The Board is Clean!
Ready for publishing of v1.1!

2013-12-5

Removed From Que
* Debris shows up in your property window and throws null pointer exceptions when viewing it [FIXED]

Still in Que
* Sometimes the autopilot avoid code does not avoid stations while in UT [CONFIRMED]
* NPCs stop firing when the target gets too close to them [CONFIRMED]
* Looped weapon effects don't always stop when their ship is destroyed [CONFIRMED -- Not Observed Recently]
    - Was possibly fixed in an earlier fix I implemented for another sound issue?

New
* Ships sometimes get stuck on DOCK_STAGE_3 when using the capital docking port.

Progress has been made!
-> Trade code
    - UTs (and STs) are even more profitable!
        - Located a leak in the trade code where after buying wares and undocking they used slightly too much fuel.
        - Fixed leak by making them jump directly from the docking port. Trade failure rate significantly reduced.
        - Traders also validate jump fuel before buying.
        - Traders no longer drop goods on trade failure. They will sell them eventually, it's just delayed profits.

Still in Que
* Sometimes the autopilot avoid code does not avoid stations while in UT [CONFIRMED]
* NPCs stop firing when the target gets too close to them [CONFIRMED]

New
* Debris shows up in your property window and throws null pointer exceptions when viewing it [CONFIRMED]

Progress has been made!
-> Trade code
    - UTs will now use their jumpdrives to escape when shields drop below 40%
    - STs/UTs will now verify selling price again before buying goods, saving wasted trips.
    - STs/UTs will now wait in a station to sell their goods no matter how long it takes.
    - STs/UTs will dump goods that cannot be sold and try a new route.
        - Will have to see how this goes. If too much money is being lost, might be changed.

-> Station code
    - Docking reservations changed from 10 minutes to 20 minutes.
        - also benefits UTs and STs in big systems.
        - some systems were just too big for 10 minutes.
    - A station that enters dying() will now kill any docked ships.

Things that need to be added... (to be done in future versions)
-> Frigates
    - An intermediate ship class to bridge the gap between capitals and fighters.
    - Capable of mounting capital size weapons, but fewer of them.
    - Size is smaller than a superfreighter but bigger than a transport.

-> New Weapons
    - Flak Weapons
        - Capital sized anti-fighter weapons.
        - The HGPC is pretty good already.
        - AoE flak would be badass.

    - More Ammo Based Fighter Weapons
        - Since there's no weapon energy, ammo based weapons need to be 'special'.
        - Phased Meson Cannon
            - Penetrates shields and does damage directly to hull.
            - Does low damage, but has a high refire rate.
            - Short range.
            - Sold by Gunpower.
        - Inverse Field Thrower
            - Extremely strong against shields but does little hull damage.
            - High damage, low refire rate.
            - Medium range.
            - Sold by Gunpower.

-> Capturable fighters
    - All fighters have a bail chance determined in FACTION.txt
    - Bail is calculated every time the hull drops by _another_ 10%.
        - but only if the player is shooting at it!
    - When a ship bails it ejects an astronaut.
    - The ship will become neutral and can be claimed by hotkey when targeted.
    - The ship will "self destruct" if the player leaves the system.
        - read despawn

-> Sellable ships
    - Will have to think how to do this well.

-> After that is all done, stations need some love.
    - Customizable prices for buying and selling.
    - Ability to assign a ship to buy or sell a ware for a station.
    - Maybe deployable point defenses to protect stations?

Removed from Que
* Sometimes undock stage 3 never ends [MAYBE FIXED]
* UTs seem to decide to fly into infinity. [COULD NOT REPRODUCE]
* Aborting a dock then manually docking with a different station docks you in the station you aborted. [COULD NOT REPRODUCE]

Still in Que
* Sometimes the autopilot avoid code does not avoid stations while in UT [CONFIRMED]
* NPCs stop firing when the target gets too close to them [CONFIRMED]

New
* Looped weapon effects don't always stop when their ship is destroyed [CONFIRMED]

Also, need to take a look at
-> Trade code, both ST and UT, needs a serious overhaul.
    - traders often fill up on goods they can't sell
        - problem is that they abort the sell operation because they'd sell at a loss
            - possibly make them keep looking for a place to sell this good?
            - possibly sell what you can and trash the rest?
        - another problem: they don't make sure their trade is still profitable right before buying
            - so they buy, fly all the way to the bad sell price station, and then can't sell.
    - traders leave profitable areas when there is momentarily no trade route
            - definately want them to migrate if there are no possible routes ever
            - but they need to stay if there was a trade route that is temporarily depleted

It might also help if players could see the price of goods at a station without docking.

Also, need to take a look at
-> NPCs getting stuck on stuff (until their fuel runs out / they kill themselves)
-> NPCs nudging stations off the map
-> UTs filling with useless wares due to failed trade runs
        -> either sell the stuff somewhere else or dump it and cut losses

Would be nice
-> UTs jump away when in danger
-> Report lost property to the player via message
-> Visible way of detecting incoming new messages (currently audio only)
