Also, need to take a look at
-> NPCs getting stuck on stuff (until their fuel runs out / they kill themselves)
-> NPCs nudging stations off the map
-> UTs filling with useless wares due to failed trade runs
        -> either sell the stuff somewhere else or dump it and cut losses

Would be nice
-> UTs jump away when in danger
-> Report lost property to the player via message
-> Visible way of detecting incoming new messages (currently audio only)
