* Sometimes the autopilot avoid code does not avoid stations while in UT [FIXED]
* Looped weapon effects don't always stop when their ship is destroyed [FIXED]
    - was observed again, fixed it by making the stop method more aggressive.
* Ships sometimes get stuck on DOCK_STAGE_3 when using the capital docking port. [FIXED]

The Board is Clean!
Ready for publishing of v1.1!

* NPCs stop firing when the target gets too close to them [CONFIRMED]
* Looped weapon effects don't always stop when their ship is destroyed [CONFIRMED -- Not Observed Recently]
    - Was possibly fixed in an earlier fix I implemented for another sound issue?

New
* Ships sometimes get stuck on DOCK_STAGE_3 when using the capital docking port.

Progress has been made!
-> Trade code
    - UTs (and STs) are even more profitable!
        - Located a leak in the trade code where after buying wares and undocking they used slightly too much fuel.
        - Fixed leak by making them jump directly from the docking port. Trade failure rate significantly reduced.
        - Traders also validate jump fuel before buying.
        - Traders no longer drop goods on trade failure. They will sell them eventually, it's just delayed profits.

Progress has been made!
-> Trade code
    - UTs will now use their jumpdrives to escape when shields drop below 40%
    - STs/UTs will now verify selling price again before buying goods, saving wasted trips.
    - STs/UTs will now wait in a station to sell their goods no matter how long it takes.
    - STs/UTs will dump goods that cannot be sold and try a new route.
        - Will have to see how this goes. If too much money is being lost, might be changed.

-> Station code
    - Docking reservations changed from 10 minutes to 20 minutes.
        - also benefits UTs and STs in big systems.
        - some systems were just too big for 10 minutes.
    - A station that enters dying() will now kill any docked ships.

Things that need to be added... (to be done in future versions)
-> Frigates
    - An intermediate ship class to bridge the gap between capitals and fighters.
    - Capable of mounting capital size weapons, but fewer of them.
    - Size is smaller than a superfreighter but bigger than a transport.

-> New Weapons
    - Flak Weapons
        - Capital sized anti-fighter weapons.
        - The HGPC is pretty good already.
        - AoE flak would be badass.

    - More Ammo Based Fighter Weapons
        - Since there's no weapon energy, ammo based weapons need to be 'special'.
        - Phased Meson Cannon
            - Penetrates shields and does damage directly to hull.
            - Does low damage, but has a high refire rate.
            - Short range.
            - Sold by Gunpower.
        - Inverse Field Thrower
            - Extremely strong against shields but does little hull damage.
            - High damage, low refire rate.
            - Medium range.
            - Sold by Gunpower.

-> Capturable fighters
    - All fighters have a bail chance determined in FACTION.txt
    - Bail is calculated every time the hull drops by _another_ 10%.
        - but only if the player is shooting at it!
    - When a ship bails it ejects an astronaut.
    - The ship will become neutral and can be claimed by hotkey when targeted.
    - The ship will "self destruct" if the player leaves the system.
        - read despawn

-> Sellable ships
    - Will have to think how to do this well.

-> After that is all done, stations need some love.
    - Customizable prices for buying and selling.
    - Ability to assign a ship to buy or sell a ware for a station.
    - Maybe deployable point defenses to protect stations?

* Sometimes undock stage 3 never ends [MAYBE FIXED]
* UTs seem to decide to fly into infinity. [COULD NOT REPRODUCE]
* Aborting a dock then manually docking with a different station docks you in the station you aborted. [COULD NOT REPRODUCE]

Also, need to take a look at
-> Trade code, both ST and UT, needs a serious overhaul.
    - traders often fill up on goods they can't sell
        - problem is that they abort the sell operation because they'd sell at a loss
            - possibly make them keep looking for a place to sell this good?
            - possibly sell what you can and trash the rest?
        - another problem: they don't make sure their trade is still profitable right before buying
            - so they buy, fly all the way to the bad sell price station, and then can't sell.
    - traders leave profitable areas when there is momentarily no trade route
            - definately want them to migrate if there are no possible routes ever
            - but they need to stay if there was a trade route that is temporarily depleted

It might also help if players could see the price of goods at a station without docking.

Also, need to take a look at
-> NPCs getting stuck on stuff (until their fuel runs out / they kill themselves)
-> NPCs nudging stations off the map
-> UTs filling with useless wares due to failed trade runs
        -> either sell the stuff somewhere else or dump it and cut losses

Would be nice
-> UTs jump away when in danger
-> Report lost property to the player via message
-> Visible way of detecting incoming new messages (currently audio only)
