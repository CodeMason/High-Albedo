subject=Property
body=You are capable of owning and managing many ships and space stations. Press P to see a list of all your property. When you select from this list you can remotely manage the ship computer, cargo, and even self destruct the asset. This window will become vital to your success later on when you have many things going on at once around the universe, but for now I'd use it as an autopilot system for your current craft.

# Generic Rumors -- all factions should have these

[Node]
name=GenericRumor0
subject=Wormholes
body=I've heard there's a secret team of scientists trying to restart the old UN's exodus project, but I'm not sure why. Maybe they think they can target the wormholes better, although anything is better than random.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=GenericRumor1
subject=Entities? How Many?
body=Nobody likes to talk about it, but how many of those entities do you think are out there? Just one of those things can destroy every station in a system before a battleship shows up to deal with it.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=GenericRumor2
subject=Casual Travel
body=I personally don't like jumpholes. They scare the hell out of me, but a jumpdrive can be even worse. I knew someone who's ship exploded because it jumped inside an ITC Ice Refinery. Tough luck huh?
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=GenericRumor5
subject=Trading Space
body=I personally think ITC space is the easiest to trade in, but the militarization is overwhelming. Orin's not too bad, but you can forget about Caina and Ageira.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=GenericRumor6
subject=Cardinal Heart
body=I've heard the codename for the region of space we had to settle was 'Cardinal Heart'. That's a weird name for an unknown region of space you've never seen, don't you think?
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=GenericRumor7
subject=Foundation War
body=If my history's right the Foundation War was a pretty brutal civil war where the UN Preliminary Government fractured into 3 new nations. The ITC managed to get out of it, barely.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=GenericRumor8
subject=Very Tense
body=This region is a powder keg ready to go off for any reason. Border skirmishes are constant, sometimes a battleship captain decides to take a trip into enemy space.

#Ageiran Federation Rumors

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-ITCConspiracy0
subject=ITC Conspiracy?
body=Nobody *really* knows for sure, obviously, but a lot of people think the ITC either created or awoke the entities as part of some weapons development or something. The UN was doing lots of experiments, the way I see it the ITC could have inherited those too.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-TheArchers0
subject=The Archers
body=The Archers are causing us some serious problems. They destroy trade ships every day and almost always win 1 on 1 against the police and navy patrols. We kill them by boxing them in so their superior acceleration doesn't help, but that's tricky. I can't believe how we let this pirate problem get out of hand!
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-EscalationImminent0
subject=Escalation Imminent
body=I've heard from a friend that there's going to be a lot more than skirmishes pretty soon. The Navy is prepping some Condors for a full scale assault on ITC space. So goes the rumor anyway.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Caina0
subject=Caina and ITC
body=The Cainan Dictatorship, that they like to call a Kingdom or Conglemerate, or whatever, would have fallen by now if not for the ITC. They're keeping them propped up for access to their rich asteroid ores and as a meat shield when the Second Foundation War kicks in.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-SecondWarExcited
subject=I'm Excited
body=Personally I'm excited there's going to be a new Foundation War soon. It gives us a chance to rebuild the Union Commonwealth, except better. Not to mention the adventure!
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Deficit0
subject=Federal Deficit
body=We can't possibly fight another war even if we wanted to. We have a debt measured in quadrillions of credits, and they've raised the ceiling and borrowed form the Orin Federation dozens of times in the past 20 years. All this posturing is going to do is get us into another pointless war with the ITC and Caina, just like the first time we did this. This time we'll lose because the economy is collapsing. People forget quickly.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Animosity0
subject=Ageiran Animosity
body=This entire cold war thing is pointless. The first war we had with the ITC and Caina was when we *invaded* Caina, unprovoked, for minerals and territory. We, the Ageirans, overthrew our corrupt Union government and built not one but 2 new nations. We swore we'd make peace and do reparations, but that never happened. Truth is neither side is forgiving the other, and that makes it all to easy to spar without justification.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Economics0
subject=Ageiran Economics
body=The Fed runs mining operations on planets, they extract mineral ore and atmospheric gases and lift them to customs offices. From there they make energy and refined products, which we make into anything we need.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Condor0
subject=Ageiran Economics
body=The Condor is a beautiful ship. It flies majestically through the stars defending the Federation and all it stands for. Where the Condor roams, freedom rings.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Ships0
subject=Ageiran Ships
body=Our ships aren't weak, not by a long shot. Our ships are boring, sure, but practical. We aren't criplingly specialized and are very versatile. I've seen Sparrow pilots kill ITC Hyenas in skirmishes, so don't let anyone tell you our ships are poor.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-OrinConcern0
subject=Orin Concerns
body=They are allies, but sometimes I wonder why. The Orin share many of our values and a common history and culture, sure, but they *want* a war with the ITC in the worst way. They'll deny that of course, but trust me they want a Second Foundation War.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

#Orin Federation Rumors

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Economics0
subject=Orin Economics
body=Our economy is based on converting waste into something useful. We start with a fission reactor, which makes energy and waste. The waste is converted into a mass block, and we can make it into whatever we need. Our process is inefficient though, if those ITC dogs would share with us we could have an economy rivaling theirs.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Missiles0
subject=Missile Massacre
body=Unlike the Ageirans we appreciate the value in missiles as an anti-fighter platform. Did you know that our capital rocket pods can fire a missile every quarter second? That's firepower.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Fetch
subject=The Fetch
body=The Fetch is my favorite battleship. I'm biased, sure but you can't deny its ability to tear apart fighters at close range, and it still packs the punch for hitting stations. Of course it eats ammo, but our ammo's cheap.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-ITC0
subject=The ITC
body=I hate the ITC. They got out of fighting the Foundation War with *politics* while real patriots were fighting for their independence. I think they're the UN reincarnated, you can't deny the similarities. No doubt they're responsible for the Entities.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-ITC1
subject=The Real ITC
body=The ITC might as well not even be human. Fine, they're human, but they don't act like normal people. They're conniving, back stabbing, and selfish. Many ITC citizens emigrated from the Union before it collapsed. Traitors, all of them. If you ever get the chance to kill an ITC citizen, do it.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Knights0
subject=The Knights
body=The Knights are crazy. They think some Aztec King ruled all of Earth and gave Spanish to the Africans or some bull. They want to overthrow both us and the Cainans and institute some kind of 'true monarchy' with the descendents of this so-called King who aren't even the right race! I wish they'd go fight the Cainans only and leave us alone.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-BorderWar0
subject=The Border War
body=I speak for most people when I say we're glad there's border skirmishes with the Cainans and ITC. Especially with the ITC. All ITC citizens will burn in hell for their ways.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-BorderWar1
subject=Wrong Border War
body=Don't get me wrong, I hate the Cainans as much as the next guy, but the ITC is the priority. They're far stronger, far more advanced, and much more villanous. I can't stand how apologetic my senators are to the ITC! The people want justice, we want a war, only the Fed wants to 'make peace'. You can't make peace with the ITC.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-DeepConcern0
subject=Deeply Concerned
body=It's hard to tell how many people really hate the ITC with how vocal they are, but I for one don't. I watch ITC news and don't see this evil empire so many others do. I hope my senator doesn't vote for war. Fortunately, the senate is not interested in a war, only war mongering arm chair generals who've never fought a war are. They are paranoid, conspiracy theorists, who blame their problems on anyone but themselves.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-ITC3
subject=The ITC Truth
body=No doubt my fellow Orin have told you how evil the ITC are. If you ask them why they are evil, they won't be able to give you any specifics - there are none! The ITC have done nothing to provoke us, and we've done everything to villify them. I make my voice heard by writing my senator every now and then to help them keep perspective. I've gotten some great replies!
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-TheITCIlluminatiConspiracy
subject=The ITC Illuminati Conspiracy
body=Face the facts. The ITC invented the Entities as an experimental weapon, and lost control. The ITC have been poisoning consumer good shipments with low levels of lead. The ITC Illuminati intend to conquer the world using business interests and politics. The ITC prop up the Cainan dictatorship. The ITC invest heavily in powerful warships. The ITC are so cowardly they try to fight beyond visual range! They are the scum of the universe.
