#Ageiran Federation Rumours

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-ITCConspiracy0
subject=ITC Conspiracy?
body=Nobody *really* knows for sure, obviously, but a lot of people think the ITC either created or awoke the entities as part of some weapons development or something. The UN was doing lots of experiments, the way I see it the ITC could have inherited those too.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-TheArchers0
subject=The Archers
body=The Archers are causing us some serious problems. They destroy trade ships every day and almost always win 1 on 1 against the police and navy patrols. We kill them by boxing them in so their superior acceleration doesn't help, but that's tricky. I can't believe how we let this pirate problem get out of hand!

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Caina0
subject=Caina and ITC
body=The Cainan Dictatorship, that they like to call a Kingdom or Conglemerate, or whatever, would have fallen by now if not for the ITC. They're keeping them propped up for access to their rich asteroid ores and as a meat shield when the Second Foundation War kicks in.

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Deficit0
subject=Federal Deficit
body=We can't possibly fight another war even if we wanted to. We have a debt measured in quadrillions of credits, and they've raised the ceiling and borrowed form the Orin Federation dozens of times in the past 20 years. All this posturing is going to do is get us into another pointless war with the ITC and Caina, just like the first time we did this. This time we'll lose because the economy is collapsing. People forget quickly.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Animosity0
subject=Ageiran Animosity
body=This entire cold war thing is pointless. The first war we had with the ITC and Caina was when we *invaded* Caina, unprovoked, for minerals and territory. We, the Ageirans, overthrew our corrupt Union government and built not one but 2 new nations. We swore we'd make peace and do reparations, but that never happened. Truth is neither side is forgiving the other, and that makes it all to easy to spar without justification.

body=Our ships aren't weak, not by a long shot. Our ships are boring, sure, but practical. We aren't cripplingly specialized and are very versatile. I've seen Sparrow pilots kill ITC Hyenas in skirmishes, so don't let anyone tell you our ships are poor.
choice0=Good To Know/END

name=AgeiranRumor-OrinConcern0
subject=Orin Concerns

choice0=Good To Know/END

#Orin Federation Rumours

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Economics0
subject=Orin Economics
body=Our economy is based on converting waste into something useful. We start with a fission reactor, which makes energy and waste. The waste is converted into a mass block, and we can make it into whatever we need. Our process is inefficient though, if those ITC dogs would share with us we could have an economy rivalling theirs.

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Fetch
subject=The Fetch
body=The Fetch is my favourite battleship. I'm biased, sure but you can't deny its ability to tear apart fighters at close range, and it still packs the punch for hitting stations. Of course it eats ammo, but our ammo's cheap.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-ITC0
subject=The ITC
body=I hate the ITC. They got out of fighting the Foundation War with *politics* while real patriots were fighting for their independence. I think they're the UN reincarnated, you can't deny the similarities. No doubt they're responsible for the Entities.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-ITC1
subject=The Real ITC
body=The ITC might as well not even be human. Fine, they're human, but they don't act like normal people. They're conniving, back stabbing, and selfish. Many ITC citizens emigrated from the Union before it collapsed. Traitors, all of them. If you ever get the chance to kill an ITC citizen, do it.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Knights0
subject=The Knights
body=The Knights are crazy. They think some Aztec King ruled all of Earth and gave Spanish to the Africans or some bull. They want to overthrow both us and the Cainans and institute some kind of 'true monarchy' with the descendants of this so-called King who aren't even the right race! I wish they'd go fight the Cainans only and leave us alone.

name=OrinRumor-BorderWar1
subject=Wrong Border War
body=Don't get me wrong, I hate the Cainans as much as the next guy, but the ITC are the priority. They're far stronger, far more advanced, and much more villainous. I can't stand how apologetic my senators are to the ITC! The people want justice, we want a war, only the Fed wants to 'make peace'. You can't make peace with the ITC.

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-DeepConcern0
subject=Deeply Concerned
body=It's hard to tell how many people really hate the ITC with how vocal they are, but I for one don't. I watch ITC news and don't see this evil empire so many others do. I hope my senator doesn't vote for war. Fortunately, the senate is not interested in a war, only warmongering arm chair generals who've never fought a war are. They are paranoid, conspiracy theorists, who blame their problems on anyone but themselves.

name=OrinRumor-ITC3
subject=The ITC Truth
body=No doubt my fellow Orin have told you how evil the ITC are. If you ask them why they are evil, they won't be able to give you any specifics - there are none! The ITC have done nothing to provoke us, and we've done everything to vilify them. I make my voice heard by writing my senator every now and then to help them keep perspective.

subject=History of Starstruck
body=Before the Union Commonwealth, now deceased, invaded Caina we didn't have the Starstruck Missile. We suffered heavy casualties keeping Caina from being conquered for no good reason.

name=ITCRumor-OrinScary0
subject=Orin Scares Me
body=I'm not scared of the Ageirans. I like the Ageirans, I like their culture, I like their music. But the Orin are terrifying. For some reason the Orin general public thinks we are the cause of all their problems, including insane claims that we made the Entities. We didn't make those damn things, they do plenty of damage to us too. Why would we make such a thing? At any rate, the Orin might get their war soon. Careful what you wish for.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=ITCRumor-WhyTheyHateUs0
subject=Why They Hate Us
body=I finally figured out why they hate us so much. It's because we are the only country that has our act together. We don't have deep economic and sociopolitical problems like they do, and we use that to invest in more infrastructure to make ourselves even richer. They hate us because they want to be us, but they can't. I feel sorry for them in a way.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=ITCRumor-ITCGovernment0
subject=ITC Government
body=The ITC is an oversight body that standardizes currency, developmental policies, human rights rules, and military. Each member planet has their own local government, usually a representative republic of some kind. But all of them meet our strict human rights rules, so any ITC planet is a good place to live.

name=ITCRumor-Lion

[Node]
name=ITCRumor-Inventions0
subject=ITC Inventions
body=The ITC have invented lots of neat stuff in our history. We invented the Plank Tube, which replaced the SQUID based quantum computing module. Plank Tubes are far more reliable, our computers are state of the art. We invented nanoweave textiles, which allow the creation of light, thick, flexible structures that are very strong. We even invented the jumpdrive, although we don't use it much because it's unsafe.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=ITCRumor-Jumpholes
subject=Jumpholes
body=The ITC have studied jumpholes extensively. They occur naturally in this region of space, but we don't know how they form. We do know how they work - they are expanded holes in the topography of the universe which allow vessels to safely pass. We used this information to design and build a working jumpdrive, which generates a jumphole for a few nanoseconds. We're working on generating stable ones to add new trade paths.

[Node]
name=ITCRumor-Isolation
subject=ITC Isolation
body=A surprising number of ITC citizens never leave ITC space for any reason, leaving them at a loss to what the rest of the world is like. I've been outside the ITC and it's a ghetto by comparison. Most people here are politically correct and say that we're just as good as everyone else, but facts are the ITC is far superior to any other nation in this region.

[Node]
name=ITCRumor-CrazyOrin
subject=Crazy Orin
body=The Orin call us cowards, thieves, and liars because we didn't fight the bloody Foundation War like they did.

[Node]
name=CainanRumor-AgeiranHope0
subject=Ageiran Hope
body=The Orin are insane, but the Ageirans are reasonable people. They're the only thing keeping the Orin extremists in check. The common heritage of the two federations makes it difficult for the Ageirans to go against their Orin allies, but the Ageirans will have a choice soon to either dissolve relations with the Orin or get involved in a Second Foundation War.

[Node]
name=CainanRumor-ITCNotSoGood0
subject=Squeaky Clean ITC?
body=Nobody will deny the ITC are an amazing country, but as allies they come up a little short. They never help on the offensive, they let us fight the border war on our own. They won't share their more advanced ships with us, nor will they give us the codes to unlock ITC Warheads. They don't seem to understand the importance of this situation. Maybe if their country was falling apart they'd care more.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=CainanRumor-ITCNotSoGood1
subject=Our ITC Friends
body=There's some animosity here that the ITC doesn't have our interests at heart. Sure they saved us from the Union Commonwealth, but they won't help us stomp out the Knights problem, or secure our borders. My theory is that they think they're better than us, and that they are the ones in charge.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=CainanRumor-SlaveProblem0
subject=Slaves
body=Slavery is legalized here now. Good King Daveth III decreed that prisoners captured from pirate raids or destroying Federal incursions should be put to work in asteroid mines.

[Node]
name=CainanRumor-OrganProblem0
subject=Human Organs
body=How can we get rid of pirates when we cooperate with them? The Wolves fill a demand for human organs, which we just don't have enough of. The problem is that many of those organs come from Cainan military forces who ejected right before their ship was destroyed by the Wolves. If we want the Wolves to go away we need to stop buying organs from them.

[Node]
name=CainanRumor-Goanna
subject=The Goanna
body=We designed our battleship from the ground up! It's faster than your average capital, and makes a good compromise between defence against raiders, attacking hard targets, and not using too much ammo. We're quite proud of it. We wanted to fit ITC missile batteries to it, but they wouldn't let us.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=CainanRumor-Escalation0
subject=Incoming Escalation
body=For most people in Caina it isn't a question of who will attack but when. Everyone here expects the Orin to defy their Ageiran friends and launch a new invasion of Caina, or the ITC. They'll hope that the Ageirans feel obligated to assist them, we certainly hope the Ageirans don't.

name=RedSky-TheWolves0

body=The Wolves aren't traditional pirates. They're into the illegal human organ trade, and they slaughter anyone they take prisoner for more organs to sell. The Caina Conglemerate buys those organs, perpetuating the cycle. Good news is they can't make friends, so they're the weaker one.
