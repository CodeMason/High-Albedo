[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-ITCConspiracy0
subject=ITC Conspiracy?
body=Nobody *really* knows for sure, obviously, but a lot of people think the ITC either created or awoke the entities as part of some weapons development or something. The UN was doing lots of experiments, the way I see it the ITC could have inherited those too.

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-TheArchers0
subject=The Archers
body=The Archers are causing us some serious problems. They destroy trade ships every day and almost always win 1 on 1 against the police and navy patrols. We kill them by boxing them in so their superior acceleration doesn't help, but that's tricky. I can't believe how we let this pirate problem get out of hand!

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Deficit0
subject=Federal Deficit
body=We can't possibly fight another war even if we wanted to. We have a debt measured in quadrillions of credits, and they've raised the ceiling and borrowed form the Orin Federation dozens of times in the past 20 years. All this posturing is going to do is get us into another pointless war with the ITC and Caina, just like the first time we did this. This time we'll lose because the economy is collapsing. People forget quickly.
choice0=Good To Know/END
[/Node]

[Node]
name=AgeiranRumor-Animosity0
subject=Ageiran Animosity
body=This entire cold war thing is pointless. The first war we had with the ITC and Caina was when we *invaded* Caina, unprovoked, for minerals and territory. We, the Ageirans, overthrew our corrupt Union government and built not one but 2 new nations. We swore we'd make peace and do reparations, but that never happened. Truth is neither side is forgiving the other, and that makes it all to easy to spar without justification.

#Orin Federation Rumors

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-Economics0
subject=Orin Economics
body=Our economy is based on converting waste into something useful. We start with a fission reactor, which makes energy and waste. The waste is converted into a mass block, and we can make it into whatever we need. Our process is inefficient though, if those ITC dogs would share with us we could have an economy rivaling theirs.

name=OrinRumor-Fetch

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-ITC0
subject=The ITC
body=I hate the ITC. They got out of fighting the Foundation War with *politics* while real patriots were fighting for their independence. I think they're the UN reincarnated, you can't deny the similarities. No doubt they're responsible for the Entities.
choice0=Good To Know/END

[Node]
name=OrinRumor-ITC1
subject=The Real ITC
body=The ITC might as well not even be human. Fine, they're human, but they don't act like normal people. They're conniving, back stabbing, and selfish. Many ITC citizens emigrated from the Union before it collapsed. Traitors, all of them. If you ever get the chance to kill an ITC citizen, do it.

name=OrinRumor-Knights0

body=The Knights are crazy. They think some Aztec King ruled all of Earth and gave Spanish to the Africans or some bull. They want to overthrow both us and the Cainans and institute some kind of 'true monarchy' with the descendents of this so-called King who aren't even the right race!

body=Don't get me wrong, I hate the Cainans as much as the next guy, but the ITC is the priority. They're far stronger, far more advanced, and much more villanous. I can't stand how apologetic my senators are to the ITC! The people want justice, we want a war, only the Fed wants to 'make peace'. You can't make peace with the ITC.

body=It's hard to tell how many people really hate the ITC with how vocal they are, but I for one don't. I watch ITC news and don't see this evil empire so many others do. I hope my senator doesn't vote for war. Fortunately, the senate is not interested in a war, only war mongering arm chair generals who've never fought a war are. They are paranoid, conspiracy theorists, who blame their problems on anyone but themselves.

body=No doubt my fellow Orin have told you how evil the ITC are. If you ask them why they are evil, they won't be able to give you any specifics - there are none!

For some reason the Orin general public thinks we are the cause of all their problems, including insane claims that we made the Entities.

name=ITCRumor-WhyTheyHateUs0
subject=Why They Hate Us
body=I finally figured out why they hate us so much. It's because we are the only country that has our act together. We don't have deep economic and sociopolitical problems like they do, and we use that to invest in more infrastructure to make ourselves even richer. They hate us because they want to be us, but they can't. I feel sorry for them in a way.

name=ITCRumor-ITCGovernment0
subject=ITC Government
body=The ITC is an oversight body that standardizes currency, developmental policies, human rights rules, and military.

subject=ITC Inventions
body=The ITC have invented lots of neat stuff in our history. We invented the Plank Tube, which replaced the SQUID based quantum computing module. Plank Tubes are far more reliable, our computers are state of the art. We invented nanoweave textiles, which allow the creation of light, think, flexible structures that are very strong. We even invented the jumpdrive, although we don't use it much because it's unsafe.

name=ITCRumor-Jumpholes
subject=Jumpholes
body=The ITC have studied jumpholes extensively. They occur naturally in this region of space, but we don't know how they form. We do know how they work - they are expanded holes in the topography of the universe which allow vessels to safely pass. We used this information to design and build a working jumpdrive, which generates a jumphole for a few nanoseconds. We're working on generating stable ones to add new trade paths.

body=A surprising number of ITC citizens never leave ITC space for any reason, leaving them at a loss to what the rest of the world is like. I've been outside the ITC and it's a ghetto by comparison. Most people here are politically correct and say that we're just as good as everyone else, but facts are the ITC is far superior to any other nation in this region.

name=CainanRumor-ITCNotSoGood0
subject=Squeeky Clean ITC?

They won't share their more advanced ships with us, nor will they give us the codes to unlock ITC Warheads. They don't seem to understand the importance of this situation.

body=Slavery is legalized here now. Good King Daveth III decreed that prisoners captured from pirate raids or destroying Federal incursions should be put to work in asteroid mines.
