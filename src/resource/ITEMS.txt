HP=100
minPrice=5
maxPrice=25
group=powercell

[Item]
name=Hydrocarbon
type=commodity
volume=8
mass=3
HP=100
minPrice=2500
maxPrice=5000
group=ore
description=Since the dawn of man hydrocarbons have been burned in low tech reactors to generate energy. They have a much higher energy density than solar energy, but a lower energy density than nuclear fusion. One hydrocarbon unit can easily produce several hundred energy units, however hydrocarbon supplies are harder to locate than the extremely abundant solar energy.  /br/ /br/ Many stations are capable of using hydrocarbons to generate their power, and Ageiran Customs Offices will do the conversion as well so that the resulting energy can be sold at a profit to small scale traders.

[Item]
name=Industrial Waste
type=commodity
volume=1
mass=0.5
HP=100
minPrice=0
maxPrice=5
group=ore
description=When something is burned, built, or processed there are often toxic industrial wastes produced. These wastes are often reusable with the right equipment, creating a cottage industry of moving waste to refinement plants. When in doubt, however, waste is often just ejected. /br/ /br/ Industrial waste is a rare commodity in that it is often given away for free by factories so that a trader will take it off their hands so manufacturing can continue.

[Item]
name=Consumer Goods
type=commodity
volume=1
mass=2
HP=100
minPrice=20
maxPrice=250
group=ore
description=Consumer goods are household items that are relatively easy to produce. Small personal fabrication devices are ubiquitous and capable of converting a sufficient quantity of input materials into a desired good. This process is so lightweight that it often doesn't require any additional energy beyond what all stations can generate internally, making consumer goods manufacturing an attractive option for light stations such as customs offices.

name=Exotic Matter
type=commodity
volume=-10
mass=-10
HP=100
minPrice=50000000
maxPrice=250000000
group=exoticmatter
description=In the 20th and 21st centuries it was theorized that one could create matter that had a negative rest mass, essentially violating some energy conditions in relativity and creating the most powerful thing in existence. This material would behave very, very, strangely in our universe and allow for things like wormholes, warp drive, and making things levitate without using power. /br/ /br/ Negative mass has been synthesized in a laboratory, but in small quantities and at extreme expense. It has vast applications making it a highly expensive and desired commodity. No natural sources are known, and the particle synthesis process to generate it is insanely expensive for most organizations. /br/ /br/ Negative mass was used to open wormholes to random locations in the universe during the Exodus project which created our civilization. Unfortunately the Exodus experiments proved that it was possible to make traversable wormholes, but impossible to target them to a specific location meaning anyone sent through would be, in all odds, lost in space forever. /br/ /br/ This variant of exotic matter also has a negative volume, since it causes space to expand in its presence. If the negative mass manages to cancel the mass of your craft, or make it negative, you will notice some interesting behavior when you collide with something.
