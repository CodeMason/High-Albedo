Markup style for data used in this game.

Let's look at this for an example:

[System]
name=Carolia
x=0
y=1
z=2
[/System]

[Grid]
name=Empty Grid
parent=Carolia
x=553
y=223
z=200
[/Grid]

This defines a system named Carolia and a Grid inside that system. This is not
XML, so you don't put children inside their parents. In fact, the relationship
between the grid and the system is totally arbitrary.

Here's how the parser sees that same data.

[(entity type 'System')]
(param 'Name')=(value 'Carolia')
(param 'x') = (value '0')
(param 'y') = (value '1')
(param 'z') = (value '2')
[(end entity type 'System')]

The terms used in this file are meaningless until interpreted by some part of
this program. There is no relationship of any kind between the "System" and the
"Grid".

[foo]
~~~~
[/foo]

Defines a term called "foo" that contains the params and values "~~~~~~~".
