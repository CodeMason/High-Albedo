[Node]

chapter="Agent Eileen"
objective=Fly to 'Brash Pegasus'
body=Eileen: Hey! You must be the freelancer our agent referred to me. I'm glad you can help because we've been having serious trouble getting an escort group for this transport. This mission should be easy, all you have to do is meet up with us in Brash Pegasus and help babysit a convoy. So get down here and join us ASAP.

######Mission 2: Intel Gathering

[Node]
name=Mission2Start
chapter="Chief Walker"
objective=Fly to 'Cadence'
body=Eileen: You've demonstrated you can be helpful. As you've probably guessed, this command doesn't have the resources it needs. We are short staffed, lacking in equipment, and overworked keeping trade in this area safe. We are always looking for volunteers to help out, and you are promising. I want you to meet someone, this is Chief Walker. He has a project for you. /br/ /br/ Walker: We can save the formal introductions for later, there's work to do. As you know we currently occupy Cadence, a buffer zone between ITC controlled Grace and Brash Pegasus. Ever since capturing this system we have enjoyed relative calm in Brash Pegasus, as the ITC ceased their attempts to capture that system. /br/ /br/ Eileen: Chief, get to the useful part. /br/ /br/ Walker: We believe the ITC are trying to destabilize our control of Cadence by paying The Archers to harass military supply lines there. The Archer problem is getting out of control there, and due to current deployments we don't have the manpower to deal with it. We need to prove to the Navy that there is a connection between the ITC and The Archers, because they believe that piracy is a police issue and not our problem. If we can prove the ITC are involved, we'll have half the fleet ready to attack Grace in hours. We'll demand answers or else. /br/ /br/ Eileen: It seems likely they have a secret base in Grace, and we want you to find it. Since you're a freelancer I assume you can enter Grace freely and poke around. I can't really tell you what to look for, but you should report anything unusual. /br/ /br/ Walker: If you can locate proof of an Archer presence in Grace, Admiral Leeroy could be convinced to do something about it. /br/ /br/ Eileen: Good luck!

[/Node]

[Node]
name=Mission2Waiting
chapter="Nothing to See"
objective=Wait for orders.
body=Walker: Nothing interesting here, it was worth a shot. I guess it would be a little too convenient to find evidence that quickly. I'm going to confer with some better sources and find out what's going on. I'll contact you when I have something for you to do. /br/ /br/ Eileen: In the mean time, you should probably take a look around and familiarize yourself with the area, find some work to do.

######Mission 3: Convoy Raid

[Node]
name=Mission3Start
chapter="About Time"

body=Walker: If you're still interested in helping out, come back to the supply base in Brash Pegasus. We have a new mission for you.

next=Mission3Briefing
[/Node]

[Node]
name=Mission3Briefing
chapter="Reporting In"
objective=Fly to Cadence
body=Walker: Eileen is away at the moment so you're getting the briefing from me. We still don't know what is going on but we do have a target, we are going after an Archers' transport that is leaving Cadence and headed back to Grace. An Archers' transport moving into ITC space is suspicious and we aren't going to let that happen. The transport is currently in Cadence heading towards the Grace jumphole, if it reaches there we are out of luck because we don't have authorization to enter ITC space. You'll be joining a wing of fighters that will be intercepting them before they can make it to Grace. Good luck!

chapter="Admiral Leeroy"
objective=Fly to Grace
body=Leeroy: Alright everyone listen up! I have been informed that the Cainans have been paying The Archers to attack us in Brash Pegasus. Obviously, we will not stand for this. I am pleased to announce that I have authorization to lead a massive attack on Grace to demand answers. Our target will be 2 ITC research installations in Grace. One located near the star, one located near the planet. Apparently those installations are what this is all about. /br/ /br/ Eileen: I'm a civilian so let me tell you that we aren't sure what is going on, but the answer is in Grace. Admiral Leeroy feels this is the best option to get answers, and you're welcome to come along. /br/ /br/ Walker: If you want to help just meet us in Grace as soon as possible, this is going to happen quickly.
